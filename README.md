Activity from Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course about a virtual bank in Vanilla JS
WELCOME TO BANKIST APP 
 This is an activity from Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript Course 
 I followed the course's guidelines but used my own approach , changed the code to make it as concise and DRY as possible I used method chaining and logical operator chaining , ternary operators and destructuring  
 App functionalities :✨Login
 
✨Get loan from bank
✨Transfer to another account
✨For every action you must introduce id and pin (e.g: if you want to transfer to another user you must introduce his/her  id)
✨Close account
✨Log out after 5 minutes of inactivity
✨Sort movements in ascending or descending order
✨Currency internationalization according to users location account
✨Date internationalization according to users location account
✨Project 100% front end using vanilla JS  so changes doesn't persist in any DB  everything will be back to default after refresh
✨Validation for  movements (e.g: user can only have a loan if its amount is  equal or higher than 10% of at least one deposit in his/her account  user can only transfer to existing accounts and only transfer and amount equal or lower that his/her current balance user can't transfer money to himself/herself) 
These are the valid accounts that you can use to log in
